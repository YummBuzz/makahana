             <strong> Cookies and
             Other Tracking Technologies</strong><br /><br />
              We may use cookies and similar tracking
            technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
            information. Specific information about how we use such technologies
            and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie
            Policy.
            <br /><br /><strong> Security of Your Information</strong> <br /><br /> We use administrative,
            technical, and physical security measures to help protect your
            personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure
            the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that
            despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
            impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
            against any interception or other type of misuse. <br /><br /> <strong>Data Retention</strong> <br /><br /> We
            will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no
            ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
            information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
            or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
            securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
            further processing until deletion is possible. <br /><br /><strong>Your Privacy Rights
              </strong> <br /><br />
            In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain
            rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
            right to: <br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
              Request access and obtain a copy of your personal
              information.
              </li>
              <li>
              Request rectification or erasure.
              </li>
              <li>
              Restrict the
              processing of your personal information.
              </li>
              <li>
              If applicable, to data
              portability.

            </ul>
            <br /><br />
              If we are relying on your consent to process your
            personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
            any time. Note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of
            the processing before its withdrawal. <br /> If you wish to exercise any of
            these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided
            below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
            applicable data protection laws. <br /><br />
